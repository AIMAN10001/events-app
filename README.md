## Backend Development

Develop the backend API to handle event creation, browsing, and user authentication:

1. Create API routes for CRUD operations on events.
2. Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
3. Set up MongoDB models and connect to the database.
4. Write tests to ensure the functionality of your backend.

## Frontend Development

Build the frontend interface using Next.js:

1. Design and develop UI components for event creation, browsing, and user authentication.
2. Integrate API calls to interact with the backend.
3. Implement functionalities such as user registration, login, event creation, and RSVP.

## Deployment

Deploy your application to a hosting platform:

1. Set up deployment configurations for both frontend and backend.
2. Deploy the frontend to Vercel or similar platforms.
3. Deploy the backend to a cloud hosting service like Heroku or AWS.
4. Ensure proper configuration of environment variables and database connections.
